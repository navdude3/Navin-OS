Bug Log:

//checkpoint 1

Type of Error: semantic
Symptom that drew attention: general_protection_fault return 
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): realized our PIC init was incorrect, did not need to restore the masks (took about 1 hour to find)

Type of Error: semantic
Symptom that drew attention: keyboard presses not echoed
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): irq for the keyboard was not enabled, very simple fix that took about 10-15 minutes to find

Type of Error: algorithmic
Symptom that drew attention: page fault/kernel crash
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): did not set the CR4 register value correctly when initializing paging

Type of Error: semantic
Symptom that drew attention: paging not working as intended
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): wrong values were put into the paging struct when mapping out the bit values

Type of Error: semantic
Symptom that drew attention: only able to input 1 key at a time
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): did not set up the end of interrupt properly when initializing keyboard

Type of Error: algorithmic
Symptom that drew attention: RTC not working as intended, not printing values in proper timing
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): flag in rtc handler not set properly, quick 5-10 minute fix

Type of Error: semantic
Symptom that drew attention: printf causing a page fault
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): simply got rid of it, one line change took about 10 minutes

//checkpoint 2

Type of Error: algorithmic
Symptom that drew attention: backspace at begining column and row would cause a page fault
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): needed to add edge checker if cursor is at the point, took about 5 minutes

Type of Error: semantic
Symptom that drew attention: enter key would cause random errors and sometimes newline would not be sent
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): changed \e (our original implementation), to just be \n on an enter key press since its basically just that

Type of Error: semantic
Symptom that drew attention: array used to hold tabs began to become overcomplicated during row shifts
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): hacky way by modifying attrib for that specific location to indicate a tab was there

Type of Error: algorithmic
Symptom that drew attention: ctrl l command would reset terminal buffer in an incorrect way
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): add condition checker if ctrl l is seen to not send it to the buffer, only the keyboard space

Type of Error: semantic
Symptom that drew attention: keyboard interrupt was not able to interrupt the terminal read
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): flag needed to be volatile as it needed to be updated constantly, very easy fix

Type of Error: algorithmic
Symptom that drew attention: user buffer would print out wacky characters as it was reading random stuff from memory
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): fill the buffer with empty spaces in case random data would be there

Type of Error: semantic
Symptom that drew attention: rtc speed could not change
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): case statement did not have break statements which caused max speed to always be set

Type of Error: algorithmic
Symptom that drew attention: rtc rate unchanged
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): added a set_rate call in rtc_write
