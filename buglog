Bug Log:

// Checkpoint 1

Type of Error: semantic
Symptom that drew attention: general_protection_fault return 
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): realized our PIC init was incorrect, did not need to restore the masks (took about 1 hour to find)

Type of Error: semantic
Symptom that drew attention: keyboard presses not echoed
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): irq for the keyboard was not enabled, very simple fix that took about 10-15 minutes to find

Type of Error: algorithmic
Symptom that drew attention: page fault/kernel crash
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): did not set the CR4 register value correctly when initializing paging

Type of Error: semantic
Symptom that drew attention: paging not working as intended
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): wrong values were put into the paging struct when mapping out the bit values

Type of Error: semantic
Symptom that drew attention: only able to input 1 key at a time
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): did not set up the end of interrupt properly when initializing keyboard

Type of Error: algorithmic
Symptom that drew attention: RTC not working as intended, not printing values in proper timing
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): flag in rtc handler not set properly, quick 5-10 minute fix

Type of Error: semantic
Symptom that drew attention: printf causing a page fault
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): simply got rid of it, one line change took about 10 minutes

// Checkpoint 2

Type of Error: algorithmic
Symptom that drew attention: backspace at begining column and row would cause a page fault
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): needed to add edge checker if cursor is at the point, took about 5 minutes

Type of Error: semantic
Symptom that drew attention: enter key would cause random errors and sometimes newline would not be sent
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): changed \e (our original implementation), to just be \n on an enter key press since its basically just that

Type of Error: semantic
Symptom that drew attention: array used to hold tabs began to become overcomplicated during row shifts
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): hacky way by modifying attrib for that specific location to indicate a tab was there

Type of Error: algorithmic
Symptom that drew attention: ctrl l command would reset terminal buffer in an incorrect way
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): add condition checker if ctrl l is seen to not send it to the buffer, only the keyboard space

Type of Error: semantic
Symptom that drew attention: keyboard interrupt was not able to interrupt the terminal read
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): flag needed to be volatile as it needed to be updated constantly, very easy fix

Type of Error: algorithmic
Symptom that drew attention: user buffer would print out wacky characters as it was reading random stuff from memory
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): fill the buffer with empty spaces in case random data would be there

Type of Error: semantic
Symptom that drew attention: rtc speed could not change
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): case statement did not have break statements which caused max speed to always be set

Type of Error: algorithmic
Symptom that drew attention: rtc rate unchanged
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): added a set_rate call in rtc_write

// Checkpoint 3

Type of Error: algorithmic
Symptom that drew attention: page faulting
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): forgot to set the DPL to 3 in the IDT. Took us around 2 hours to figure out and was only a one line fix

Type of Error: algorithmic
Symptom that drew attention: page faulting
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): Kernel stack overflow because we declared an inode entry (4kb) in sys_execute twice so the stack (8kb) was filling up too quickly. Fixed in about an hour
and only had to change one line

Type of Error: algorithmic
Symptom that drew attention: page faulting
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): entry location for page directory entry was off by factor of four because of erroneous left shift of 2 bits, 
fixed in under 30 minutes and only had to delete the shift

Type of Error: semantic
Symptom that drew attention: execute called random call when only a space was written to terminal
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): terminal buffer was initially filled with spaces for CP2, so we changed this to fill with null terminators (/0). 
Took about an hour to fix and was only modifying a few lines

Type of Error: algorithmic
Symptom that drew attention: page faulting
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): was not accessing correct PCB for new processes because of an int casting issue, lead to accessing wrong place in
physical memory. Took a few hours to find and moved the int cast

Type of Error: semantic
Symptom that drew attention: halt not working
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): we were accessing the current and parent PCBs incorrectly, took few hours to create helper functions (called get_pcb and
get_cur_pcb) and changed logic around to fix this

Type of Error: algorithmic
Symptom that drew attention: page faulting
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): forgot to set the DPL to 0 in the IDT. Took us around 2 hours to figure out and was only a one line fix

Type of Error: algorithmic
Symptom that drew attention: able to type more than 128 characters to the terminal buffer
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): made changes in the keyboard handler to not fill the buffer with output after the 128th character


//Checkpoint 4

Type of Error: algorithmic
Symptom that drew attention: args were not parsing correctly
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): made changes in how we check for spaces after the file name


Type of Error: semantic
Symptom that drew attention: args array being initialized with jibberish
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): iniital for loop to clear the args array so all jibberish is gone


Type of Error: semantic
Symptom that drew attention: fish program was not running after the first frame
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): the rtc was not being set properly, we forgot to add a break in our case statement 


Type of Error: algorithmic
Symptom that drew attention: non real programs would cause machine to use up a tcb slot
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): rewrote the order of execute to account for incorrect words


Type of Error: algorithmic
Symptom that drew attention: cat printout would only display first 128 bytes
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): we had a 128 charachter cap on our write buffer which should not have been there


Type of Error: algorithmic
Symptom that drew attention: newlines was not being displayed after cat on certain programs
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): remove the 128 charachter cap allowed program to display a \n at end of program for cat

//Checkpoint 5

Type of Error: algorithmic 
Symptom that drew attention: Fish would only execute on terminal 1/2 if ctrl+l was used in that terminal prior
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): 1 hour - had to call the clear() function in switch_terms


Type of Error: algorithmic 
Symptom that drew attention: Fish would display on every terminal regardless of which terminal it was called on 
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): we had to flush_tlb() prior to our memcpy in switch_terms


Type of Error: algorithmic 
Symptom that drew attention: three shells would not launch on startup 
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): several hours - added multiple different arrays to check for current and active processes and wrote the switch_terms function 


Type of Error: algorithmic
Symptom that drew attention: three shells would launch but the process_arrray = [1,2,-1]
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): changed how parent_pid was set and removed 


Type of Error: 
Symptom that drew attention: 
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made): cur_term_id vs schedulers id


Type of Error: 
Symptom that drew attention: 
Difficulty finding bug (time and changes made):
